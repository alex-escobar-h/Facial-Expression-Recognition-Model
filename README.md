# Facial Expression Recognition Model
This repository contains a  facial expression recognition model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) from Kaggle. The dataset contains 48x48 grayscale images of human faces, each labeled with one of seven emotions: 
1. Angry
2. Disgust
3. Fear
4. Happy
5. Neutral
6. Sad
7. Surprise

## Dataset Overview
FER-2013 provides 28,709 training examples along with 3,589 examples in the public test set. We decided a CNN would be the best model architecture for this project due to its strong ability to extract spatial features from visual data and learn patterns that are useful for image classification.
